abstract = {We present Adaptic, a novel ”hybrid” active/passive haptic device that can change shape to act as a proxy for a range of virtual objects in VR. We use Adaptic with haptic retargeting to redirect the user’s hand to provide haptic feedback for several virtual objects in arm’s reach using only a single prop. To evaluate the effectiveness of Adaptic with haptic retargeting, we conducted a within-subjects experiment employing a docking task to compare Adaptic to non-matching proxy objects (i.e., Styrofoam balls) and matching shape props. In our study, Adaptic sat on a desk in front of the user and changed shapes between grasps, to provide matching tactile feedback for various virtual objects placed in different virtual locations. Results indicate that the illusion was convincing: users felt they were manipulating several virtual objects in different virtual locations with a single Adaptic device. Docking performance (completion time and accuracy) with Adaptic was comparable to props without haptic retargeting.},
