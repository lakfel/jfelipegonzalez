      <description>Abstract We present Adaptic, a novel &amp;ldquo;hybrid&amp;rdquo; active/passive haptic device that can change shape to act as a proxy for a range of virtual objects in VR. We use Adaptic with haptic retargeting to redirect the user’s hand to provide haptic feedback for several virtual objects in arm’s reach using only a single prop. To evaluate the effectiveness of Adaptic with haptic retargeting, we conducted a within-subjects experiment employing a docking task to compare Adaptic to non-matching proxy objects (i.</description>

      <description>Imagine interacting with virtual objects in VR and feeling as if you&amp;rsquo;re actually handling them, all while using just a single device. That’s exactly what we aimed to achieve with Adaptic, our innovative haptic device. Unlike traditional props, Adaptic is a shape-changing device that can transform its form to match various virtual objects you’re manipulating in VR.&#xA;Here’s how it works: Adaptic uses a clever technique called haptic retargeting to adjust its shape and provide realistic feedback for different virtual items.</description>
