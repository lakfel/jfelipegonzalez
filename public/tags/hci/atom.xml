      <description>Abstract Parametric Computer-aided design (CAD) enables the creation of reusable models by integrating variables into geometric properties, facilitating customization without a complete redesign. However, creating parametric designs in programming-based CAD presents significant challenges. Users define models in a code editor using a programming language, with the application generating a visual representation in a viewport. This rocess involves complex programming and arithmetic expressions to describe geometric properties, linking various object properties to create parametric designs.</description>

      <description>Abstract Direct manipulation has been established as the main interaction paradigm for Computer-Aided Design (CAD) for decades. It provides fast, incremental, and reversible actions that allow for an iterative process on a visual representation of the result. Despite its numerous advantages, some users prefer a programming-based approach where they describe the 3D model they design with a specific programming language, such as OpenSCAD. It allows users to create complex structured geometries and facilitates abstraction.</description>

      <description>Abstract 3D Computer-Aided Design (CAD) users need to overcome several obstacles to benefit from the flexibility of programmatic interface tools. Besides the barriers of any programming language, users face challenges inherent to 3D spatial interaction. Scripting simple operations, such as moving an element in 3D space, can be significantly more challenging than performing the same task using direct manipulation. We introduce the concept of bidirectional programming for Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) CAD tools, informed by interviews we performed with programmatic interface users.</description>

      <description>Abstract We present Adaptic, a novel &amp;ldquo;hybrid&amp;rdquo; active/passive haptic device that can change shape to act as a proxy for a range of virtual objects in VR. We use Adaptic with haptic retargeting to redirect the user’s hand to provide haptic feedback for several virtual objects in arm’s reach using only a single prop. To evaluate the effectiveness of Adaptic with haptic retargeting, we conducted a within-subjects experiment employing a docking task to compare Adaptic to non-matching proxy objects (i.</description>

      <description>Imagine interacting with virtual objects in VR and feeling as if you&amp;rsquo;re actually handling them, all while using just a single device. That’s exactly what we aimed to achieve with Adaptic, our innovative haptic device. Unlike traditional props, Adaptic is a shape-changing device that can transform its form to match various virtual objects you’re manipulating in VR.&#xA;Here’s how it works: Adaptic uses a clever technique called haptic retargeting to adjust its shape and provide realistic feedback for different virtual items.</description>

      <description>Hello, designer with a programming background in CAD! This project is all about making your 3D design experience smoother and more enjoyable, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re the kind of person who loves getting into the code. It&amp;rsquo;s based on my PhD thesis, which you can check out here.&#xA;You know how most 3D CAD tools are pretty intuitive, with those drag-and-drop interfaces that let you tweak your designs with ease? Well, there’s another side to CAD—a programming-based approach.</description>

      <description>Parametric Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is a game-changer when it comes to creating customizable and reusable 3D models. By using variables in your designs, you can tweak and adjust models without starting from scratch. However, when it comes to programming-based CAD tools, things can get pretty complicated. These tools require users to code every aspect of their designs, linking various properties with complex mathematical expressions. This process can be daunting and error-prone, especially without much in the way of helpful assistance.</description>

      <description>Working with 3D Computer-Aided Design (CAD) can be incredibly powerful, especially when you dive into the world of programming-based tools. But let’s face it—while these tools offer flexibility, they also come with their own set of challenges. Unlike traditional drag-and-drop CAD interfaces, scripting in a tool like OpenSCAD can be tricky. Simple tasks, like moving an element in 3D space, can become complex and frustrating when you’re just dealing with code.</description>

      <description>Computer-Aided Design (CAD) has long been dominated by direct manipulation tools—those intuitive, visual interfaces where designers can drag, drop, and tweak their creations with ease. While this approach has its merits, there&amp;rsquo;s a growing community of designers who prefer to take a different route: programming-based CAD. Tools like OpenSCAD allow users to describe their 3D models using code, offering unmatched precision and the ability to create complex, parametric designs. However, this method comes with its own set of challenges that are often overlooked.</description>
