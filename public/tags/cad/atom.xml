      <description>Hello, designer with a programming background in CAD! This project is all about making your 3D design experience smoother and more enjoyable, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re the kind of person who loves getting into the code. It&amp;rsquo;s based on my PhD thesis, which you can check out here.&#xA;You know how most 3D CAD tools are pretty intuitive, with those drag-and-drop interfaces that let you tweak your designs with ease? Well, there’s another side to CAD—a programming-based approach.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Challenges of OpenSCAD Users for 3D Printing</title>

      <description>Computer-Aided Design (CAD) has long been dominated by direct manipulation tools—those intuitive, visual interfaces where designers can drag, drop, and tweak their creations with ease. While this approach has its merits, there&amp;rsquo;s a growing community of designers who prefer to take a different route: programming-based CAD. Tools like OpenSCAD allow users to describe their 3D models using code, offering unmatched precision and the ability to create complex, parametric designs. However, this method comes with its own set of challenges that are often overlooked.</description>
