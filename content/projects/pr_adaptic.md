description: "Our project addresses the challenge in VR of handling multiple interactable objects using props that match the object's shape. By integrating a versatile shape-changing prop with haptic retargeting technology, we create the sensation of interacting with various objects in different VR spaces using just one physical prop. Take a look at our compelling results."

Imagine interacting with virtual objects in VR and feeling as if you're actually handling them, all while using just a single device. That’s exactly what we aimed to achieve with Adaptic, our innovative haptic device. Unlike traditional props, Adaptic is a shape-changing device that can transform its form to match various virtual objects you’re manipulating in VR.

Here’s how it works: Adaptic uses a clever technique called haptic retargeting to adjust its shape and provide realistic feedback for different virtual items. Instead of using multiple props to match the shapes of virtual objects, Adaptic changes its form to fit the virtual objects within your reach. This means you get accurate tactile feedback with just one device, making the VR experience feel more immersive and less cluttered.

To see how well Adaptic performs, we ran a detailed experiment comparing it with both shape-matching props and simple non-matching ones. Users completed a docking task where they interacted with virtual objects using Adaptic. The results were promising: users felt like they were handling several different objects realistically, and their performance was on par with using matching props.

Adaptic’s design leverages the power of visual cues in VR to create a versatile and effective haptic device. While there was a slight trade-off in performance compared to using shape-matching props, Adaptic still provided a nearly equivalent experience. Users appreciated the convenience of having a single adaptable device, even if it wasn’t always a perfect match for every virtual object.

Looking ahead, we’re excited to refine the Adaptic prototype and explore its potential in various applications like training, simulations, and gaming. We’ll also be diving into how the position of virtual objects affects haptic feedback and whether revealing the use of haptic retargeting upfront changes users' experiences.

Adaptic represents a significant step towards making VR interactions more dynamic and intuitive. Stay tuned as we continue to develop this technology and push the boundaries of virtual reality!
