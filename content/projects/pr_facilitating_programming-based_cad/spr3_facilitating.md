description_list: "I focused on the challenge of defining geometric properties in parametric designs—a real pain point for many users. For instance, defining the exact dimensions or relationships between different parts of a model can get pretty complex. I analyzed a bunch of OpenSCAD models and developed new features to make it easier to define and manipulate these properties right from the 3D view. When I tested these new features with users, the results were promising. Not only did it make the design process faster and less error-prone, but it also made it much easier for beginners to jump in and start creating."

Parametric Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is a game-changer when it comes to creating customizable and reusable 3D models. By using variables in your designs, you can tweak and adjust models without starting from scratch. However, when it comes to programming-based CAD tools, things can get pretty complicated. These tools require users to code every aspect of their designs, linking various properties with complex mathematical expressions. This process can be daunting and error-prone, especially without much in the way of helpful assistance.

In my research, I tackled these challenges head-on. I introduced a new approach that lets users easily retrieve parametric expressions from their visual designs and reuse them in the code. Imagine being able to pull a parameter directly from the visual representation and apply it to your code seamlessly—sounds like a game-changer, right?

I tested this concept with a modified version of OpenSCAD, a popular programming-based CAD tool. By incorporating features that enable this bidirectional interaction, I aimed to make the design process more intuitive and less reliant on advanced mathematical skills. In an experiment with 11 users, the results were promising. Users found that this approach not only reduced design errors but also made the process more engaging and accessible, particularly for those new to programming-based CAD.

By making parametric design more user-friendly and interactive, my research aims to lower the entry barrier for newcomers and enhance the overall design experience. Dive into the details to see how these enhancements can simplify your design workflow and make parametric CAD a lot more approachable!
