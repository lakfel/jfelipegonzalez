## Hola! 👋

I'm J. Felipe Gonzalez, a tech enthusiast driven by a deep passion for hardware and software innovations.

I recently completed my Ph.D. in Information Technology with a specialization in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), co-supervised between the prestigious <a href='https://www.univ-lille.fr/'>Université de Lille</a> in France and <a href='https://carleton.ca/'>Carleton University</a> in Canada. My dissertation, <a href='https://hal.science/tel-04635570'>Facilitating Programming-based 3D Computer-Aided Design using Bidirectional Programming</a>, delves into groundbreaking methodologies for enhancing 3D CAD through bidirectional programming.

Prior to this, I earned my M.Sc. in Systems and Computing Engineering from <a href='https://uniandes.edu.co/'>Universidad de los Andes</a> in Colombia, where I also completed dual undergraduate degrees in Electronic Engineering and Systems and Computing Engineering.

My research interests are diverse, spanning from haptics in virtual reality (VR) to digital embedded systems, signal and image processing, and data science. One of my goals is to apply my expertise in the field of astronomy... let's see where that takes me.   

With hands-on experience in research laboratories across Colombia, Canada, and France, I bring a global perspective to my work. I'm also a polyglot, fluent in Spanish, English, French, and Portuguese, with a passion for learning new languages.

This website is a gateway to my work and interests... :D
